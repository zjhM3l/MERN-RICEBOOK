# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

遇到的典型的困难：
1. 前后端分离开发的端口冲突
2. 谷歌的cors问题，前后端测试跨域传输内容CORS报错，用的库cors或者设置google解决
3. signup表单验证过程的逻辑顺序问题，一次返还很多message打包的object，怎么匹配对应的位置，怎么让对应的提示显示在对应的textfield的helpertext上
4. 以及密码的特殊性，因为要处理成hash，在密码进入后端验证的时候已经变hash了，所以永远过不了validate，因此要在controller这一步就处理这个message
，这样的话又带来了另一个问题，因为其他的验证在数据库，pwd在controller，所以pwd优先级更高，表单为空也是同理，即便别的输入有问题，如果controller这一步检测到了密码强度和有空的话，也不会提示除此之外的message。
